<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of
this desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds
with which the Military History of our country abounds.
To hold forth these bright examples to the imitation of the
youthful soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the
meritorious conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have given
rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the "London Gazette," from whence they are
transferred into the public prints: the achievements of our
armies are thus made known at the time of their occurrence,
and receive the tribute of praise and admiration to which
they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions, the Houses
of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for
their skill and bravery, and these testimonials, confirmed by
the high honour of their Sovereign's Approbation, constitute
the reward which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular
records of their services and achievements. Hence some
difficulty has been experienced in obtaining, particularly
from the old Regiments, an authentic account of their origin
and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its
services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will
henceforth derive information as to the difficulties and
privations which chequer the career of those who embrace
the military profession. In Great Britain, where so large a
number of persons are devoted to the active concerns of
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and where these
pursuits have, for so long a period, been undisturbed by the
<em>presence of war</em>, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which, even
during peace, the British Troops are exposed in every part
of the globe, with little or no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the
agriculturist and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be
supposed not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the
soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the
sacrifice of valuable life, by which so many national benefits
are obtained and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and
endurance, have shone conspicuously under great and trying
difficulties; and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they
have effected debarkations in spite of the most formidable
opposition, and by the gallantry and steadiness with which
they have maintained their advantages against superior
numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant
exertions of the Corps employed; but the details of their
services, and of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully
given in the Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty's special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting
to military men of every rank, it is considered that they will
also afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in the
Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit de Corps</i>&mdash;an
attachment to every thing belonging to their Regiment;
to such persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps
cannot fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the
actions of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always
been of paramount interest with a brave and civilized people.
Great Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments
of danger and terror, have stood, "firm as the rocks
of their native shore;" and when half the World has been
arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a
record of achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers,&mdash;our
fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory
of the brave, and brings their gallant deeds before us, will
certainly prove acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their
respective Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which
have, from time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment,
as testifying the value and importance of its services,
will be faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up
in numerical succession.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1715, when treachery,
treason, and mistaken notions of duty, united
with the intrigues of foreign courts, menaced
Great Britain with domestic war, and when the
expectations of the friends of the Pretender were
become sanguine of effecting his speedy elevation
to the throne, King George I. augmented the
regular army, and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth Regiment of
Dragoons</span> was raised in the midland counties of
England, by Brigadier-General <span class="smcap">Richard Munden</span>,
whose valour, loyalty, and devotion to the
house of Hanover were undoubted. The following
officers were appointed to the regiment by
commissions dated the 22nd of July, 1715.</p>

<p>After its formation the regiment occupied
quarters in Cheshire, where it was stationed,
under the command of Major-General Wills,
when the rebellion in Scotland, headed by the
Earl of Mar, commenced. When the insurgents,
under General Forster and Brigadier-General
Mackintosh, advanced into Lancashire, the regiment
was directed to proceed towards Manchester,
to confront and fight the rebel bands;
it was formed in brigade with Stanhope's dragoons
(afterwards disbanded), under the command
of its colonel, Brigadier-General Munden, and at
break of day on the 12th of November, it advanced
towards <em>Preston</em>, where the rebels had
taken post, and had barricaded the avenues of
the town. After driving in the rebel piquets,
the king's troops formed, about three in the
afternoon, opposite the main streets; a squadron
of the regiment dismounted, to take part in
storming the avenue leading to Wigan, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
other two squadrons supported the storming
party which attacked the avenue leading to Lancaster.
The first barrier was carried in gallant
style; but the inner barricade could not be forced
for want of cannon. The soldiers took possession
of some buildings, threw a breastwork across the
road, and set the houses between the breastwork
and barricade on fire; thus blockading the insurgents
in the town. Major-General Carpenter
afterwards arrived with some additional forces,
and the rebel bands surrendered at discretion.
The regiment had four men and twelve horses
wounded in this service, and its colonel was
thanked for his gallant conduct at the head of
one of the storming parties.</p>

<p>After escorting the rebel prisoners to the
nearest gaols, the regiment was placed in cantonments
in Lancashire, where it was stationed until
the final suppression of the rebellion in Scotland,
by the troops under the Duke of Argyle, in the
early part of 1716.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716<br />1717</div>

<p>The regiment assembled in April, 1716, at
Manchester, where it was inspected, and afterwards
marched into dispersed quarters in Wiltshire;
in April, 1717, it marched into the counties
of Berks and Hants, and passed the following
winter at Worcester and Bromsgrove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1718</div>

<p>In the spring of 1718 the regiment marched
to Gloucester and Tewksbury: a reduction in the
army took place, and in the autumn of this year,
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons embarked at Liverpool
for Ireland, to replace a regiment ordered to
be disbanded in that country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1719<br />1722<br />1725</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons were stationed in
Ireland during the remainder of the reign of
King George I., and also during the first fourteen
years of the reign of King George II. Their
colonel, Brigadier-General Munden, was removed,
in 1722, to the eighth dragoons, and was succeeded
by Brigadier-General Sir Robert Rich,
Baronet, whose regiment of dragoons, raised in
1715, had been disbanded. On the decease of
Brigadier-General Munden, in 1725, Sir Robert
Rich was removed to the eighth dragoons, and
was succeeded by Colonel William Stanhope,
afterwards Earl of Harrington, who raised a regiment
in 1715, which was disbanded in 1718.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1730</div>

<p>Lord Harrington was appointed Secretary of
State, and the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons was conferred, on the 7th of July,
1730, on Colonel Henry Hawley, from the
thirty-third foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1735<br />1739<br />1740<br />1741</div>

<p>Colonel Hawley was promoted to the rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of brigadier-general in 1735, to that of major-general
in 1739, and was removed to the Royal
Dragoons in May, 1740, when he was succeeded
by Colonel Robert Dalway, from the thirty-ninth
foot. This officer died in November of
the same year, and in January, 1741, King
George II. conferred the colonelcy of the regiment
on Colonel Humphrey Bland, from the
thirty-sixth foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>In 1742 a British army was sent to Flanders,
to support the house of Austria against the combined
efforts of the King of France and the
Elector of Bavaria, and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons
were withdrawn from Ireland, and stationed
in South Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>Brigadier-General Bland was removed to the
third dragoons in April, 1743, and King George
II. promoted Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">James Gardiner</span>,
from the Inniskilling Dragoons, to the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>Colonel Gardiner left the sixth dragoons in
Germany, and joined his regiment in England,
and being a most zealous and efficient officer, he
bestowed much care on its discipline, equipment,
and the condition of the horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons were stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in Scotland when the rebellion, headed by Charles
Edward, eldest son of the Pretender, broke out in
that country in the summer of 1745, and they
were ordered to take post at Stirling, from
whence Lieut.-General Sir John Cope, the commander-in-chief
in Scotland, advanced with a
small force into the Highlands, but he was
unable to stop the progress of the numerous
bands of mountaineers which had joined the
Pretender's standard, and he embarked with some
infantry from Aberdeen for Leith. When the
rebel army advanced to cross the Firth, the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons moved to Falkirk, and
their commanding officer, Colonel Gardiner, was
desirous of being reinforced by other troops, in
order to be enabled to make some effectual opposition;
but he was suddenly ordered to proceed
with his own and Hamilton's (fourteenth) dragoons,
by forced marches, to Dunbar, to join Sir
John Cope. This hasty retreat before an enemy
which the soldiers were desirous of attacking,
produced a bad effect on the minds of the men,
and they were further disheartened by hearing
that the rebels had gained possession of Edinburgh,
towards which city they were directed to
advance. The young Pretender put the clans in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
motion to meet the king's troops, who were not
half so numerous as their opponents; and on the
20th of September the two armies confronted
each other near the village of <em>Preston-pans</em>, seven
miles from Edinburgh. When the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons had formed in line, Colonel Gardiner
rode along the ranks and addressed the men in
the most animated manner; the soldiers desired
to be led against the enemy, and Colonel Gardiner
suggested to Sir John Cope the advantages
which would probably result from an immediate
attack on the insurgent bands; but a defensive
plan was adopted, which proved another source
of discouragement to the dragoons<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The troops passed the night in the fields, and
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons furnished videttes and
patroles to watch the motions of the rebel army,
which advanced to the attack before day-light on
the following morning. A chosen band of Highlanders
was discovered through the thick atmosphere
advancing against the right; and two
other columns of mountaineers were in motion
to join in the attack; as they drew near, they
raised a loud shout, fired a volley, threw down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
their muskets, and rushed sword in hand upon
the soldiers guarding the artillery on the right,
who, finding themselves assailed by more than
three times their own number, gave way and
fled. The dragoons, seeing the artillery lost,
became disheartened; the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> fired
their carbines, and then advanced to charge a
column of Highlanders, so numerous, that the
dragoons were dismayed, and being seized with
a sudden panic, the greater part of them fled.
A few, however, including Colonel Gardiner,
and Lieut.-Colonel Whitney, charged manfully;
Colonel Gardiner highly distinguished himself,
and though shot in the breast, refused to retire;
Lieut.-Colonel Whitney was shot in the arm,
and was forced to withdraw; Lieutenant Grafton
and Quarter-Master Burroughs were wounded
and taken prisoners; Quarter-Master West, a
man of distinguished bravery, and about fifteen
dragoons rallied round their colonel, but were
overpowered, the quarter-master was taken prisoner,
and few of the men escaped. Colonel
Gardiner afterwards rode towards some infantry,
and while in the act of encouraging them to
make a resolute stand, he was cut down by a
Highlander with a scythe fastened to a pole, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
as he fell, another Highlander gave him a mortal
blow on the head; thus terminated the career of
a most meritorious officer, who was distinguished
for strict attention to duty, personal bravery,
and christian virtues.</p>

<p>The infantry having been overpowered, the
whole fled from the field. The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons passed through Preston, and were
rallied at the west end of the town, from whence
Lieut.-General Sir John Cope retired with them
to Berwick.</p>

<p>The loss of the battle of Preston-pans proved
a serious disaster, as the rebels obtained possession
of a train of artillery, and a great quantity
of arms, and were afterwards enabled to penetrate
into England. The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons
joined the troops under Field-Marshal Wade, at
Newcastle, and afterwards returned to Scotland,
and the colonelcy was conferred on Colonel
Francis Ligonier, from the forty-eighth foot, an
excellent officer, conspicuous for zeal for the
service and personal bravery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>After the retreat of the rebels from Derby
back to Scotland, the regiment marched to
Edinburgh, where a small army was assembled
under Lieut.-General Hawley, and the rebels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
having besieged Stirling Castle, the troops advanced,
in the middle of January, 1746, to raise
the siege, and halted near <em>Falkirk</em>, where a camp
was formed. The rebels advanced to meet the
King's forces, and a general engagement was
fought on Falkirk Moor on the 17th of January.
Colonel <span class="smcap">Francis Ligonier</span>, of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons, was taken ill of a pleurisy; he was
bled and blistered on the 14th of January, but
no consideration could keep him from his duty,
and he quitted his bed and commanded the
brigade of dragoons at the battle on the 17th of
January. The action was commenced by a
charge of the cavalry; Colonel Ligonier led the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons forward with great spirit,
broke the first line of rebels, and cut down a
number of opponents, but he was unable to force
the second line, and a heavy storm of wind and
rain beat so violently in the soldiers' faces as to
produce some confusion. Lieut.-Colonel Whitney,
who had recovered from his wounds received
at Preston-pans and resumed his duty, was killed
fighting in the midst of a crowd of Highlanders;
several other officers and a number of men were
also killed and wounded. The torrent of battle
flowed in favour of the rebels, and one wing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the King's army retired; a few regiments, however,
maintained their ground with the most
heroic bravery, and were supported by Colonel
Ligonier with a party of dragoons; after dark,
the King's troops being exposed to a heavy
rain, retired to Linlithgow. Colonel Ligonier
covered the retreat with his dragoons to Linlithgow,
and being drenched with rain and
benumbed with cold, he was seized with an
inflammation in the throat, of which he died on
the 25th of January, much regretted by the
regiment.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons withdrew from
Linlithgow to Edinburgh, and when the Duke of
Cumberland took the command of the army and
advanced against the rebels, the regiment was
left at Edinburgh, and directed to patrole along
the roads leading westward to prevent the insurgents
receiving intelligence.</p>

<p>On the 17th of February, 1746, the colonelcy
was conferred on <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash; Also called Naison in this book">Philip Naizon</ins>, from the lieut.-colonelcy
of the first royal dragoons.</p>

<p>The rebellion in Scotland was suppressed by
the decisive battle of Culloden, on the 16th of
April, 1746.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748<br />1749</div>

<p>In 1748, a treaty of peace was concluded at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Aix-la-Chapelle; the dragoon regiments on
foreign service returned to England, and in the
early part of 1749, the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons
embarked for Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>Colonel Philip Naizon died in January, 1751,
and was succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons by Major-General Sir Charles
Armand Powlet, K.B. from the ninth regiment
of foot. This officer died in November of the
same year, and was succeeded by Colonel the
Honorable Henry Seymour Conway, from the
thirty-fourth regiment of foot.</p>

<p>The following particulars respecting the uniform
and guidons of the regiment, have been
extracted from a royal warrant, dated the 1st of

<div class="sidenote">1754</div>

<p>On the removal of Lieut.-General Conway to
the fourth Irish horse, now seventh dragoon
guards, in July, 1754, Colonel John Mostyn was
appointed to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons, from the Seventh <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Royal Fusileers'">Royal Fusiliers</ins>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757<br />1758<br />1759<br />1761</div>

<p>Colonel Mostyn was promoted to the rank of
major-general, in 1757, and was removed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
1758, to the Fifth Royal Irish Dragoons,&mdash;when
His Majesty conferred the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
on Archibald Douglas, from the lieut.-colonelcy
of the fourth dragoons. This officer
was one of the King's aides-de-camp and a member
of parliament, and he was promoted to the
rank of major-general in 1759, and to that of
lieut.-general in 1761.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1768<br />1770</div>

<p>In the clothing warrant of 1768, the facings
of the regiment are directed to be of <em>deep green</em>,
and the waistcoats and breeches of buff, instead
of light-green. White waistcoats and breeches
were adopted a few years afterwards, and a small
red and white feather was introduced into the
cocked-hats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Douglas died at Dublin, in
October, 1778, and was succeeded by Lieut.-General
Richard Pierson, from the thirty-sixth
foot. This officer was rewarded with the dignity
of a Knight of the Bath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>In 1779, the regiment proceeded by forced
marches to the north of Ireland, in consequence
of disturbances in that quarter, and its presence
soon restored order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons encamped in
1780, with the army in the neighbourhood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Ardfinnan,&mdash;and, on the breaking up of the
encampment, moved into quarters at Clonmel,
Carrick-on-Suir, and Cappoquin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Pierson expired suddenly on
the morning of the 13th of February, 1781, and
was succeeded by Lieut.-General Francis Craig,
from the lieut.-colonelcy of the First regiment of
Foot-Guards.</p>

<p>In 1781 the regiment marched to Charleville
and Bruff, and was subsequently stationed at
Cork, where it received orders to proceed, with
some other regiments and artillery under the
command of Colonel Ralph Abercromby, against
George Robert Fitzgerald, who had fortified his
family residence near Castlebar, in the county of
Mayo, and was in open rebellion against the laws.
On the arrival of the forces at Castlebar, they
proceeded on the service assigned to them,&mdash;but
Fitzgerald had fled and quitted the country:
some ship guns, which he had mounted, were
seized and brought into the barracks at Castlebar,&mdash;where
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> remained,&mdash;sending
detachments to Ballinrobe and Sligo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782<br />1783</div>

<p>Soon after the termination of the American
war, in 1782, the regiment underwent a change
of clothing and equipment, and was constituted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
corps of <span class="smcap">Light Cavalry</span>. The cocked-hats
were replaced by helmets, and appointments of a
lighter description than formerly worn. These
alterations were completed in 1783. In the
spring of this year the regiment was stationed
at Belturbet and Sligo; and, in consequence of
the barracks at the former place falling down in
the winter, a detachment was sent to Cavan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784</div>

<p>In 1784 the colour of the clothing was
changed from scarlet to <em>blue</em>, and the facings to
light buff.</p>

<p>In May the regiment&mdash;then designated the
"<span class="smcap">Thirteenth Light Dragoons</span>" in the Annual
Army List&mdash;again assembled at Belturbet, and,
after the usual inspection, marched into quarters
at Athlone, Roscommon, and Cloghan, when the
horses were turned out to grass for the first time
since the commencement of the American war.
After the peace the establishment had been
reduced to one hundred and forty-four men, and
one hundred and thirty-eight horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1785</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were reviewed at Athlone,
in June, 1785, and marched into quarters at Kilkenny,
Ballyragget, and Carrick-on-Suir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1786</div>

<p>In June, 1786, the regiment assembled for
inspection at Kilkenny, and marched to Mallow,
Bandon, and Tallow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>During the winter of this year the troops
were moved from Mallow to Cork, in consequence
of disturbances; and they, as well as
those at Bandon and Tallow, were constantly on
duty, and greatly harassed; the gaols were filled
with their prisoners of "White Boys," "Peep-o'day-Boys,"
&amp;c., as the different bands of these
misguided men called themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1787</div>

<p>In May, 1787, the regiment marched to
Cashel, where it was inspected, and in June it
was quartered in Maryborough, Mountmelick,
and Thurles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1788<br />1789</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded to Dublin in June,
1788, and subsequently moved into the Phœnix
Park barrack, Navan and Man of War.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1790</div>

<p>In June, 1790, the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were stationed
at Clonmel, Clogheen, Mallow, and
Charleville, and at the end of this year a
draught of men was sent to the Twentieth Dragoons
at Jamaica.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1791</div>

<p>The regiment was inspected in June, 1791,
and the detachment at Mallow was withdrawn to
Clonmel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792</div>

<p>After the inspection in May, 1792, the regiment
marched to Athlone, Roscommon, and
Portumna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time a revolution had taken
place in France, where the destructive principles
of democracy had overthrown all legitimate
authority, divested the sovereign of regal power,
and threatened to involve Europe in war.
Under these circumstances the British army
was augmented, and five men and horses were
added to each troop of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light
Dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>The French republicans having added to their
numerous atrocities the decapitation of their
sovereign, war commenced in 1793, and the
establishment of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons
was further augmented.</p>

<p>After the inspection in October, the regiment
changed its quarters to Belturbet and Sligo. It
was called upon to furnish thirty-six mounted
men to complete the cavalry regiments augmenting
for foreign service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1794 the regiment
marched to Ballinrobe and Castlebar, part of it
remaining stationed in Sligo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>The violence of party in France soon kindled
a corresponding sensation in the colonies of that
country in the West Indies, where the whites,
mulattoes, and blacks, became inflamed against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
each other, and when the decree of "<em>Equality</em>"
passed, an open rupture followed. The blacks
revolted, particularly in the island of St. Domingo.
Anarchy, massacre, and devastation
followed, and several planters obtained aid from
the English, and transferred their allegiance from
France to the British crown. Additional forces
were ordered to the West Indies. Two troops
of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons were withdrawn
from Ireland in June, 1795; they remained
a few weeks in England, and embarked, in September,
for Jamaica.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>The regiment, having received orders to prepare
for service in the West Indies, assembled at
Mallow, and there delivered over its horses for
the use of other corps; it afterwards embarked
at Cork and sailed to Bristol, where it met the
Fourteenth Dragoons, destined for the same
service. It subsequently proceeded into quarters
at Warminster and Frome, thence to Salisbury,
Winchester, and Southampton, where it embarked
in transports; and joining other vessels
containing troops belonging to the expedition,
the whole proceeded to Cove Harbour, and in
February, 1796, seven troops of the regiment
sailed for Barbadoes, where they arrived in the
beginning of April.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Bolton of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> was sent
to purchase horses in America.</p>

<p>From Barbadoes the regiment sailed to St.
Domingo; but the reduction of that island was
found to be impracticable, as the health of
European troops could not be preserved long
enough to reduce the blacks and French revolutionists
to obedience. The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light
Dragoons, partly mounted on horses sent from
America, had a few skirmishes with the armed
bands which possessed the country, and a party
of the regiment which accompanied the expedition
against the town of Bombarde, had an
opportunity of charging the enemy with great
effect; but the climate soon reduced the regiment
to a skeleton: it lost twenty officers, seven
troop quarter-masters, and two hundred and
thirty-three soldiers in six months, and the few
remaining officers and soldiers were removed to
Jamaica in December.</p>

<p>A part of the regiment, under the command
of the Honorable Colonel Walpole of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Light Dragoons, who was promoted to the
local rank of major-general, shared in the dangers
and fatigues of the harassing warfare against
the Maroons in Jamaica, until its successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
termination, which, with the consequent safety
of the island, was attributed to the talent, energy,
and courage displayed by the major-general;
and a sword of the value of five hundred
guineas was voted to him by the house of
assembly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Jamaica until July,
1798, when it transferred a few of the surviving
men to the Twentieth Light Dragoons, and the
remainder, amounting only to fifty-two individuals,
embarked for England, where they
arrived in October, and landed at Gravesend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were stationed at Trowbridge,
and subsequently at York. Every exertion
was made under the active superintendence
of Lieut.-Colonel Bolton, to complete the establishment,
which was soon effected; and in
August, 1799, the regiment marched to Birmingham.
It was shortly afterwards stationed
at Coventry, Warwick, and Stratford-on-Avon.
About this period the strength of the regiment
was increased to nine troops, amounting to eight
hundred and two men, and the same number of
horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>In 1800 part of the regiment occupied Leicester
and Nuneaton, and the establishment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
increased to ten troops. In the autumn of this
year, the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were quartered at Norwich,
Aylsham, Walsham, Beccles, Bungay, and
Wymondham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801<br />1802</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1801 the establishment
was increased to nine hundred and two men and
the same number of horses; the regiment was distributed,
at different periods during this and the
following year, in quarters at Atleborough, Dedham,
Maningtree, Norwich, Colchester, Ipswich,
Sudbury, Stowmarket, Needhammarket, Hadleigh,
Woodbridge, and Boston.</p>

<p>Hostilities with France having been terminated
by the treaty of Amiens, in the summer
of 1802 the establishment was reduced to eight
troops, amounting to five hundred and sixteen
men, and four hundred and thirty-six horses.
The quarters were changed to Romford and
Hornchurch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>The conduct of General Bonaparte, then
first consul of France, soon produced another
war, which commenced in 1803, when the
regiment was augmented to six hundred and
four men and the same number of horses; it
was quartered at Hounslow, Windsor, and Hampton
Court, and held in readiness to assist in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
repelling the threatened French invasion by an
army assembled at Boulogne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>The French armament continuing at Boulogne,
and the preparations for invading England being
augmented, in 1804, the regiment occupied Sandwich,
Stonar, and Ramsgate, with an establishment
increased to eight hundred and fifty-four
men, and seven hundred and fifty-four horses,
which was subsequently augmented to one thousand
and sixty-four men, and the same number
of horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805<br />1806</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1805, the French army
marched for Germany, and the project of invading
England was laid aside. Towards the end of
the year, the regiment was quartered at Canterbury;
and in September, 1806, it occupied Deal,
Sandwich, and Ramsgate, its strength being
reduced to eight hundred and fifty-four men and
horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807<br />1808</div>

<p>In the summer of 1807, the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
were distributed in quarters at Kingston, Richmond,
and Twickenham. The regiment was
reviewed by the Prince of Wales and the Duke
of York, and, in consequence of the high opinion
formed of it by their royal highnesses, the order
for its march to Dorchester was countermanded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and it was detained to form, with the Twelfth
Light Dragoons, a brigade, under the command
of Colonel Bolton of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, which
brigade was reviewed by His Royal Highness the
Duke of York. The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> afterwards
proceeded to Dorchester and Weymouth, from
whence detachments were sent to Radipole,
Wareham, Bridport, and, in the beginning of
1808, to Blandford, Trowbridge, and Gosport.</p>

<p>The regiment was reviewed by His Royal
Highness the Duke of Cumberland at Dorchester.
Its establishment of horses was reduced
to seven hundred and fifty-four: it assembled at
Exeter for review, and was distributed in quarters
at Totness, Modbury, Truro, Taunton, Honiton,
Tiverton, and Exeter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>In the summer of 1809, the regiment was
quartered at Hounslow, Hampton Court, Richmond,
Twickenham, Chertsey, Staines, and
Egham, and was reviewed by His Royal Highness
the Duke of Cambridge, and subsequently
by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales,
attended by their Royal Highnesses the Dukes
of York, Clarence, Cumberland, and Cambridge,
the Duke of Brunswick Oels, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>Portugal and Spain had, in the mean time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
become the theatre of war; the French emperor
had overrun those countries with troops, and
had placed his brother Joseph on the throne of
Spain; and a British army, commanded by Lord
Wellington, was aiding the inhabitants of the
Peninsula in their resistance to the gigantic
power of Napoleon. The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light
Dragoons were selected to join the Peninsular
army. Eight troops, mustering about nine hundred
officers and soldiers, embarked at Portsmouth
in February, 1810, under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Michael Head; they sailed
to Lisbon, from whence one squadron was
detached to Cadiz, which fortress was invested
on the land side by the French, and the Spanish
regency had solicited the aid of British troops.
The other six troops landed at Lisbon,&mdash;Portugal
having been delivered, by British skill and valour,
from the power of the enemy.</p>

<p>After a short halt at Belem to refresh the
men and horses after the voyage, the regiment
marched to the Alemtejo, and was attached to
the division commanded by Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill, which it joined in May, in the
neighbourhood of Portalegre. At this period a
powerful French army was about to invade Portugal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
under Marshal Massena, Prince of Esling,
who boasted he would drive the English into the
sea, and plant the eagles of France on the walls
of Lisbon; but he was ignorant of the qualities
of British soldiers, and of the abilities of their
commander. The allied army withdrew, before
the very superior numbers of the enemy, towards
Lisbon, in front of which city the celebrated
lines of Torres Vedras were forming to arrest
the torrent of invasion. The movements of the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons were connected
with those of the division under Sir Rowland
Hill, and eventually with the Portuguese cavalry
under Brigadier-General Henry Fane.</p>

<p>After withdrawing from the frontiers of Portugal,
the head-quarters were established at
Escalhos de Cima, and a troop of the regiment,
commanded by Captain William White, with a
troop of the Fourth (Portuguese) Dragoons, were
stationed at <em>Ladoera</em>, to watch the movements of
General Reynier's corps.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 22nd of August, Captain
White, when foraging with about fifty of his
troop, received information of the approach of a
reconnoitring party of about sixty French dragoons,
whom he pursued, and attacking them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
with the most distinguished bravery, wounded
several, and captured two officers, the whole of
the men, and fifty-eight horses, without sustaining
any loss.</p>

<p>Captain White, on perceiving the enemy,
sent for the troop of Portuguese cavalry, who
promptly advanced to his support, but they
could not arrive in time to take an active share
in either the conflict or capture.</p>

<p>The following report of this occurrence was
forwarded to head-quarters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">"<em>Escalhos de Cima, 22nd August, 1810.</em></p>

<p class="noindent smcap">"Sir,</p>

<p>"I have the honour to report to you that
the troop of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons,
and one of the fourth Portuguese dragoons,
under the command of Captain White of
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, at Ladoera, this morning,
fell in with a patrole of the enemy's dragoons,
consisting of one captain, two subalterns, and
about sixty men. Captain White fortunately
succeeded in coming up with them, when he
immediately charged and overturned them; and
the result has been the capture of two lieutenants,
three serjeants, six corporals, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>

report of an attack made yesterday morning by
a squadron consisting of one troop of the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> British Light Dragoons and one
troop of the Fourth Portuguese Dragoons,
under the command of Captain White of the
former, on a body of the enemy's cavalry at

two lieutenants, three serjeants, six corporals,
one trumpeter, and fifty dragoons, and about
fifty-eight horses. The conduct of Captain

and the proceeds of the sale divided among the

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>After some further retrograde movements,
Lord Wellington resolved to oppose the enemy's
forces on the rocks of <em>Busaco</em>, and during the
hard-fought battle on the 27th of September, the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons were posted in front of
Alva to observe and check the movements of the
French cavalry on the Mondego. The squadron
detached to Cadiz had, in the mean time,
returned to Portugal, and it joined the regiment
about this period.</p>

<p>After sustaining a severe repulse at Busaco,
the enemy turned the position by a flank movement,
and the allied army withdrew to the lines
of <em>Torres Vedras</em>. During the skilful performance
of these difficult operations, the numerous
cavalry of the enemy were effectually kept in
check by the British squadrons, who, by their
bold front and noble daring, whenever an opportunity
occurred, succeeded in instilling into their
adversaries a dread of their superior prowess.
The French marshal viewed the stupendous
works of Torres Vedras with astonishment and
dismay, and finding it impossible to accomplish
his threat of driving the English into the sea, he
withdrew to Santarem, when the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Light Dragoons advanced, and having crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the Tagus in boats at Valada, they proceeded
to Chamusca, a village, situated on the left bank
of the river.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons were stationed
some months at Chamusca and its neighbourhood,
where Marshal Sir William Carr Beresford
fixed his head-quarters, having under him a
strong body of troops to prevent the passage of
the Tagus, and to intercept all communications
between Marshal Massena and Marshal Soult.
In this service the regiment was employed until
the 6th of March, 1811, when the French army
having retired from Santarem, it moved forward
in pursuit, and the scenes of devastation,
slaughter, and confusion it witnessed on the
line of the enemy's disastrous retreat, exceed
description. After following the French a considerable
distance, the regiment was detached,
with other forces under Marshal Beresford, to
the relief of <em>Campo Mayor</em>, which fortress was
besieged by a detachment from Marshal Soult's
army.</p>

<p>Campo Mayor surrendered before the arrival
of the troops sent to its relief, and the French,
having dismantled the works, were marching out
of the town as the British approached it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
morning of the 25th of March,&mdash;they consisted
of nearly nine hundred cavalry, three battalions
of infantry, some horse artillery, and a battering
train of sixteen guns, under the command of
their celebrated general, Latour Maubourg.
One squadron of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons was
attached to the light division on this occasion; a
troop was with a brigade of Portuguese infantry,
and five troops were at the head of the column.
Having turned the town by the left, the regiment
sent forward one troop to skirmish with the
enemy, who retreated by the Badajoz road.
The British pressed forward in a semi-circular
form, to enclose the French, who halted with their
infantry in square, and their cavalry formed in
their front and rear. Colonel <span class="smcap">Michael Head</span>
was directed to attack with the two squadrons of
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, amounting to two hundred and
three officers and soldiers, and he led them forward
with the most distinguished gallantry<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; a regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of French hussars advanced to meet the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, and the opposing horsemen raised
a loud shout and rushed upon each other. Several
men were overthrown by the shock; the combatants
pierced through on both sides, and facing
about, charged each other again with the most
heroic bravery. A sharp sword conflict ensued,
in which the valour of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> proved
victorious, and many of the hussars having been
cut down, the remainder fled. In the mean time,
a French squadron formed on the enemy's right,
wheeled inwards, and, attacking the British left,
did some mischief; but the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> promptly
opposed, and overthrew them after a short contest.
The French continued their flight, the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> followed, and such was the ardour
of these brave swordsmen, that the fire of the
French infantry could not stop them; they galloped
forward, cut down the French gunners, and,
believing the other brigades would easily dispose
of the French troops thus passed, they continued
the pursuit. For some time the French dragoons
resisted, but their formation soon became
so completely broken, that they surrendered
as soon as they were overtaken. The pursuit
was continued at a rapid rate, the object being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to gain the front, and capture the whole, as well
as the enormous quantity of baggage on the road;
but the dragoons were not aware of what was
taking place in the rear. Marshal Beresford was
informed that the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons were
cut off; the loss of one regiment appeared to be
a serious disaster, and he did not permit the
heavy cavalry to charge. The French infantry
retiring steadily, recovered their artillery, and
effected their retreat. Meanwhile the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
and some Portuguese squadrons, commanded
by Colonel Otway, who formed as a
support during the attack, were pursuing the
French troopers at a rapid pace; on arriving
at the bridge of Badajoz, they were fired upon
by the guns of that fortress. The regiment
then halted and retired to secure the prisoners,
and captured artillery and baggage. Some of
the French drivers, refusing to surrender,
were sabred, and the mules were mounted by
men of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>. The retreat was continued
several miles, the men in high spirits
at their wonderful success; at length they were
met by the retiring French infantry, and by all the
beaten cavalry which could find refuge with it.
For a few exhausted dragoons to have engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that body of troops would have been madness,
and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were forced to abandon
their captures and make a detour to the right to
join the army, which they effected, and went into
bivouac in the neighbourhood of Campo Mayor.
The loss of the regiment was twelve men and
seven horses killed; Lieutenants William Slater
Smith and Frederick Geale, Adjutant Holmes,
Quarter-master Greenham, one serjeant, twenty-eight
rank and file, wounded; one serjeant,
nineteen rank and file, and forty-four horses
missing. Three hundred French were killed,
wounded, and taken prisoners; the French
colonel, Chamarin, of the Twenty-sixth Dragoons,
was killed in single combat by <em>Corporal
Logan</em>, of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons,
which, with many other instances of individual
bravery in this sharply contested affair, is recorded
in the books of the regiment<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, on this occasion, evinced
the superiority of their discipline over their
equally brave and numerically superior adversaries,
by their greater quickness in rallying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
after the different attacks,&mdash;and this circumstance,
with the skilful and determined use of
their weapons, greatly tended to their brilliant
success in this well-fought field.</p>

<p>An officer, who made his escape from Badajoz
a few days after this affair, reported that the
French infantry had brought in a great number
of severely wounded cavalry soldiers&mdash;chiefly
sabre wounds<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Preparations were subsequently made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
besieging Badajoz, and the Guadiana was passed
in boats in the early part of April; on the night
of the 16th of April an outpost of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons, which had been relieved by a
squadron of Portuguese cavalry, was surprised
by a body of French troops from <em>Olivenza</em>, and
only twenty men escaped. The loss was three
men wounded, Captain Morris, Lieutenant Moss,
fifty soldiers, and sixty-five horses taken prisoners.
The imagined security of their position,
induced by the Portuguese squadron being in
their front, and their consequent neglect of due
precautions, led to the surprise of this party, by
an overwhelming force of the enemy, when totally
unprepared for resistance. This was not forgotten,&mdash;and
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> never gave occasion
for the repetition of a similar severe but
wholesome lesson during the remainder of the
war.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Olivenza</em> was undertaken by the
fourth division, and the army advanced to drive
the French detachments from the province of
Estremadura. The British and Portuguese cavalry
arrived at <em>Los Santos</em> on the 16th of April,
and fell in with a body of French heavy cavalry,
when the leading troops of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
under Captains Boyse and Macalister, promptly
formed and checked the advance of the enemy.
The remainder of the regiment, commanded by
Colonel Head, quickly formed line,&mdash;charged,&mdash;cut
down many of the enemy,&mdash;took two officers
and a number of men and horses,&mdash;and
continued in close and rapid pursuit for several
miles, successfully frustrating every attempt of
the French to rally, and driving them from the
field in utter confusion. The enemy suffered
a very severe loss in killed and wounded.
The left squadron of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, partly
formed of the men who had escaped on the 6th
instant, had the satisfaction of recapturing some
of their horses and accoutrements, and severely
revenging their own and their comrades' mischance
on some of the very authors of it,
who were among their opponents on this occasion.
It was observed that these men displayed
the most determined gallantry: nothing daunted
by the superior numbers of the enemy immediately
opposed to them, they rushed fearlessly
into their ranks, and committed terrible havoc
with their sabres. Captain Doherty had a horse
shot under him in this affair. The French
commander, whose gallant bearing in leading his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
men to the attack was long a theme of admiration
among the officers who witnessed it, was
killed by private <em>James Beard</em> of the regiment,
much to the regret of those who had observed
his gallantry.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April eighteen men, who had
escaped from the enemy, rejoined the regiment.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Regiment of Light Dragoons
remained in advance when the siege of <em>Badajoz</em>
was undertaken; but withdrew, with the other
cavalry, on the advance of Marshal Soult, (who
had collected an army to succour that fortress,)
and joined the forces under Marshal Beresford at
<em>Albuhera</em>, at which place a general engagement
was fought on the 16th of May. Two squadrons
of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were posted near the river
above the bridge, with orders to defend it, and
had opportunities of making some successful
charges against the enemy's cavalry, who attempted
to cross the stream. The other two
squadrons were posted to keep in check a considerable
body of the enemy's cavalry, but they
were not seriously engaged, and their loss was
limited to one horse killed, and one man
wounded.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult, having been repulsed, retired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons were sent in pursuit
of the enemy. The French rear-guard
having been driven from <em>Usagre</em>, that post was
occupied, on the night of the 24th of May, by a
portion of the troops under Major-General Lumley;
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> being in bivouac near the
town. The French advanced on the following
day, when some sharp fighting occurred, in
which the third dragoon guards and fourth
dragoons distinguished themselves. The conduct
of Colonel Head, of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons,
as well as of every officer and soldier
present, was commended in Major-General Lumley's
despatch.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Badajoz</em> having been resumed,
Marshal Soult's army, strongly reinforced, again
advanced; Marshal Massena's army also marched
into Estremadura, and the allies again raised the
siege of Badajoz, and took up a position behind
the Caya, where the enemy did not venture to
attack them. When the French armies retired,
the Marquis of Wellington proceeded towards
the Agueda, leaving the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons
in the Alemtejo, under Lieut.-General Hill; they
were formed in brigade with the ninth dragoons
and second hussars, of the King's German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Legion, under Major-General Long, and were
stationed at Villa Viciosa, and afterwards at
Monforte, a small town nineteen miles from
Portalegre.</p>

<p>From Monforte, the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons
marched, towards the end of October, to the
Spanish frontiers, and with other troops under
Lieut.-General Hill, were engaged in the surprise
of a French force under General Girard at <em>Arroyo
de Molinos</em>. By forced marches, performed in
stormy weather, the British arrived in the
vicinity of the village at day-break on the
morning of the 28th of October; a storm of rain
with a thick mist concealed the advance, and the
French were surprised in the act of assembling
to commence their march. The cavalry marched
with every precaution to avoid giving the alarm.
The enemy's troops were soon broken; their
artillery was captured by a squadron of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>,
commanded by Captain Mansell Bowers,
and their infantry, attempting to escape by climbing
steep mountains, were intercepted, and the
greatest part made prisoners. Captain Bowers,
with his troop of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, pursued a
body of French cavalry, and captured a number
of men and horses. The conduct of Lieutenant-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Joseph Muter, who commanded the
regiment on this occasion, was commended in
Lieutenant-General Hill's public despatch.</p>

<p>Towards the end of December Lieut.-General
Hill again advanced, and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light
Dragoons were employed in an attempt to surprise
a body of French troops under General
Dombrouski at Merida. On arriving at <em>La
Nava</em>, three hundred French infantry and a party
of hussars were found in the town; they immediately
retired,&mdash;the infantry in square; and the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> and second hussars of the King's
German Legion pursued. Some sharp skirmishing
occurred, but the ground favouring the
French, they made good their retreat to Merida,
and informing General Dombrouski of the approach
of British troops, he retreated during the
night. The regiment afterwards returned to
Monforte; its loss, in the skirmish between La
Nava and Merida, was three horses killed; eleven
men, five officers' horses and fifteen troop horses
wounded; one man missing.</p>

<p>On the decease of Lieut.-General Francis
Craig, the colonelcy was conferred on Lieut.-General
the Honorable Henry George Grey, from
lieut.-colonel of the Seventh Light Dragoons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
by commission dated the 30th of December,
1811.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>While the regiment was occupying quarters
at Monforte, Ciudad Rodrigo was besieged and
captured by storm in January, 1812. When
<em>Badajoz</em> was besieged, the regiment advanced
and formed part of the covering army. During
the advance and the subsequent operations, the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were employed in the arduous outpost
duties of the army, and engaged in affairs
and skirmishes, which were of frequent occurrence,
owing to the constant alerts occasioned by
the enemy's cavalry in their front, who took
every opportunity of endeavouring to cut off the
foraging parties, patroles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the advance to Merida, in March, the
German hussars, having fallen in with the French
cavalry, commenced skirmishing, and pushed
them through the town and across the bridge.
Major-General Long ordered the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> to
gain the front at a gallop, which they did, and,
crossing the Guadiana at a deep ford, formed
and charged the enemy, who broke and fled, the
regiment following, and constantly skirmishing
with them till near dark, when it was ordered to
discontinue the pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In April the fortress of Badajoz was taken
by storm, and the army afterwards quitted Estremadura,
when the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons were
again left with Lieut.-General Hill.</p>

<p>The regiment was employed in the enterprise
against the enemy's works, which protected the
bridge across the Tagus at <em>Almaraz</em>. These were
destroyed on the 19th of May, to render the
communications between the French armies more
difficult. On this occasion the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
advanced to the high road by the pass of Mirabete,
and were in reserve while the forts were
stormed.</p>

<p>During the summer and autumn of this year,
the services of the regiment were connected with
the movements of the troops under Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill; it performed many
long marches, took part in a few skirmishes, and
penetrated into the interior of Spain.</p>

<p>In July the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, in brigade with
the ninth dragoons and second German hussars,
were engaged in a second successful affair with
the enemy at <em>Usagre</em>; and in one of the several
skirmishes, <em>Serjeant Shaw</em> of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
distinguished himself by his gallantry. Honourable
mention is also made of the firm and orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
retreat of a squadron of the regiment, commanded
by Captain <span class="smcap">Shapland Boyse</span>, before a
vastly superior body of the enemy's cavalry, by
whom they were hard pressed for a considerable
distance in the neighbourhood of Ocana.</p>

<p>A singular circumstance occurred when the
regiment was bivouacked in the neighbourhood of
Aranjuez: the horses, being unbridled for the
convenience of feeding, were linked, and the
officers and men were reposing from their
fatigues, when the Second German Hussars, who
had been ordered to join Lord Wellington's
army, filed past; the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> immediately
sprung up, and actuated by the impulse of the
moment, greeted their old comrades with a
hearty parting cheer, which so alarmed the
horses that four troops broke loose, notwithstanding
every exertion made to detain them,
and dispersed over the open country, galloping
about in squads, and scattering bridles, pistols,
carbines, &amp;c., in every direction. The scene was
truly ludicrous; but this inconsiderate act might
have been attended with serious consequences,
as the enemy was in force, particularly in cavalry,
in Aranjuez. The horses, some of which had
strayed to a distance of four or five leagues, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
had been secreted by the Spaniards, were all
brought back in the course of the day, and
scarcely an article of equipment was lost. The
exertions of Adjutant Holmes on this occasion
are particularly mentioned.</p>

<p>At the close of the campaign, when the main
army withdrew from Burgos, the troops under
Lieut.-General Hill also fell back, and the whole
were united at Salamanca.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were in reserve in the affair
at Alba de Tormes, and were engaged, with the
rear guard, in skirmishing with the enemy during
the retrograde movement of the army to the
Agueda. The horses suffered severely from want
of forage. After retiring beyond the confines of
Spain, the regiment marched to the Alemtejo,
and was quartered at Crato, where it received a
reinforcement of officers, men, and horses, from
England in December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>In February, 1813, the regiment was removed
from Crato to Monforte, where it received a
draught of one hundred and thirty-six horses
from the Ninth Dragoons, who were ordered to
return to England; at the same time a serjeant
and ten men were attached to the staff corps of
cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>At the opening of the brilliant campaign of
this year, the regiment marched towards <em>Salamanca</em>,
and was employed in the operations by
which the French troops were driven from that
city on the 26th of May. The numbers and improved
organization of the allied army enabled
the British commander to drive the enemy before
him with a strength and violence which the
French could not withstand. Rivers were
crossed, rocks and mountains were climbed, and
barren tracts traversed, with so little opposition,
that the power of the enemy appeared to be
paralyzed; but in the plains of <em>Vittoria</em> Joseph
Bonaparte made a stand, and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons took part in the engagement on the
21st of June, when the French army sustained a
decisive overthrow. The regiment supported
the attacks of the infantry on this occasion, and
subsequently received orders to advance and act
as opportunities might occur. After clearing
various obstacles in their front, the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
approached Vittoria, when the royal carriages
were perceived, and Major-General Long instantly
ordered a squadron, commanded by Captain
Doherty, to pursue them; this was promptly
executed, and the whole were captured after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sharp skirmish, in which private <em>Michael Sullivan</em>
distinguished himself, cutting down a French
officer and capturing his horses. In the mean
time, the remainder of the regiment had formed
in front of a compact body of the enemy, whom
they vigorously charged and routed. Captain
Doherty, observing this movement, left the royal
carriages in charge of serjeant Scriven and twelve
men, and joined the regiment, with which he
continued in close pursuit of the enemy during
the remainder of the day. Serjeant Scriven
reported his having given up the royal carriages
to an officer, with a party of infantry, who said
he had orders to take charge of them, but he
omitted taking a receipt or demanding the
officer's name. The commanding officer of the
regiment, Major Patrick Doherty, received a gold
medal for this battle.</p>

<p>Following the rear of the French army, the
regiment arrived at the foot of the Pyrenees, and
entering the pass through these celebrated mountains,
near Pampeluna, to furnish posts of correspondence
between the different divisions, it
proceeded to the valley of Roncesvalles,&mdash;a
place celebrated for the defeat of Charlemagne
by the Duke of Gascony, assisted by the Saracens;
a pillar erected on the spot, to commemorate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the victory, was destroyed by the French in
1794. Up this valley the French army, commanded
by Marshal Soult, advanced on the 25th
of July, and some sharp fighting occurred, which
ended in the retreat of the British to a position
in the mountains in front of Pampeluna.
The regiment, excepting one troop detached to
assist in the blockade of Pampeluna, was formed
in support of the sixth division during the severe
contest in the <em>Pyrenees</em>, and when the French
were repulsed they were pursued to the confines
of their own country.</p>

<p>The passage of the Bidassoa was effected in
the early part of October; the French were
driven from their position on the Nivelle in
November; and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, with the
Fourteenth Dragoons, were engaged in the
operations by which the passage of the <em>Nive</em>
was effected on the 9th of December. On the
following day the regiment was at <em>Hasparen</em>,
observing the movements of the French troops
under General Paris. Some fighting took place
on the three subsequent days, and the posts at
Hasparen were attacked on the 13th of December.
The gallant conduct of private <em>James Armstrong</em>
of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, on this occasion, obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
for him the distinguished honour of Sir Rowland
Hill's particular notice, and he was immediately
promoted. Being one of a small party posted to
keep up the communication, he dashed forward
and rallied some British skirmishers, who had
been forced back, placed himself at their head,
and attacked and repulsed the enemy, cutting
down some, and taking others prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>The severity of the season detained the allies
in their cantonments for a short time, during
which period the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were employed in
the outpost duties, and Lieutenant Phillips is
mentioned in the books of the regiment, as
having shown great prudence and judgment in
bringing off his piquet, when attacked and hard
pressed by the enemy's cavalry. In consequence
of the want of forage, pounded furze was given
as food to the horses.</p>

<p>In February, the army again commenced
operations, and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons were
employed in the movements connected with the
forcing of the line of the Bidouze and the Gave
de Mauleon; and in a sharp affair with the
enemy's rear-guard, private Shreenan of the
regiment distinguished himself by his great gallantry.
The regiment was engaged, on the 17th
of February, at <em>Sauveterre</em>, where Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Geale and several men and horses were killed;
serjeant-major Thomas Rosser<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> particularly distinguished
himself on this occasion. Being
detached with twelve men, he fell in with a party
of the enemy of more than double his numbers,
whom he charged three times, cutting down
three himself, and capturing some men and
horses. The same morning, previous to this
affair, the mare on which serjeant-major Rosser
was mounted was killed by a shell striking her
in her side, and he escaped without injury.</p>

<p>After several other movements, the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Light Dragoons were engaged in forcing
the French position at <em>Orthes</em>, on the 27th of
February, 1814. The right and centre of the
army assembled opposite the village of Orthes,
and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons, forming part of
the body of troops destined to turn and attack
the enemy's right, assembled near the junction
of the Gave de Pau with the Gave d'Oleron.
The village of St. Boës was carried; but the
nature of the ground required a change to be
made in the plan of the action. The narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
passage behind the village was opened, a body
of troops, including the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, pushed
through, and spread a front beyond, and the
French army was forced back with loss. Lieutenant
Robert Nesbit was severely wounded;
two men and two horses were killed, and six
horses wounded, on this occasion. In a charge
of the enemy's cavalry, which was gallantly met
and repulsed by the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, a personal
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</span> took place between Lieutenant Doherty
and the French officer who led it; the latter was
cut down, and surrendered. Many of the enemy
were sabred, and captured by the regiment. The
commanding-officer of the regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel
Patrick Doherty, received a gold clasp,
inscribed with the word "<em>Orthes</em>," to be attached
to the riband to which his Vittoria medal was
suspended.</p>

<p>On the following day the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons
pursued the enemy in the direction of
Mont de Marsan; and on the 2nd of March,
they were engaged in a slight affair at <em>Ayre</em>.</p>

<p>The British divisions continued to move forward,
and the French were everywhere driven
before the allied army.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> shared with their old comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the "ragged brigade<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>," the gallant
Fourteenth, in the advance-duties of the army,
which brought them repeatedly into collision
with the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of March, as three troops of the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel Patrick Doherty, with Major
Boyse, Captain Macalister, Lieutenants Doherty,
Drought, and Lawrence, and Brigade-Major
Dunbar, approached <em>St. Gaudens</em>, four squadrons
of French cavalry were discovered drawn up in
front of the town. Undismayed by the superior
numbers of the enemy, the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
advanced to the charge, and such was the ardour
and determined bravery with which they rushed
upon their numerous opponents, that the French
horsemen were overthrown at the first shock, and
they galloped in disorder through the streets;
but they rallied at the other side of the town,
and prepared to resist the few British troopers
whose audacity they were desirous to punish.
The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> being supported by the Third
Dragoon Guards, dashed through the town,
and rushing sword in hand upon the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
squadrons, broke them in an instant, and pursued
them for two miles, cutting many down, and
taking above a hundred prisoners, and sixty
horses. The ground was covered with cavalry
equipments, arms, and dead and wounded men
and horses. The conduct of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
was highly commended in Major-General Fane's
report of this action; the officers and soldiers
were also thanked in orders by Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill, and the signal gallantry evinced
by Captain James Macalister, who commanded
the advance on this occasion, was rewarded with
the rank of major in the army. The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
nobly upheld, on this occasion, their well-earned
fame as bold horsemen and dexterous swordsmen;
and, by their promptitude in rushing to the
attack, showed that they possessed the true spirit
of good cavalry, adding another to the many proofs
they had already given of the insufficiency of the
mere preponderance of superior numbers to resist
the shock of a determined charge<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons continued
to form part of the force in advance in the
immediate presence of the enemy; every encounter
gave additional proof of the ascendancy
which the British troops had acquired over their
opponents, and as the war drew towards a close,
this became more apparent.</p>

<p>On the 10th of April the enemy's fortified
position at <em>Toulouse</em> was attacked. The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
were at their post, but no opportunity to
charge the enemy occurred.</p>

<p>When the French withdrew from Toulouse,
the regiment advanced through the town in pursuit,
and occupied a chain of posts in front of the
allied army.</p>

<p>The war was soon afterwards terminated by
the treaty of Paris, and the Bourbon family was
restored to the throne of France.</p>

<p>Thus the conquering arms of Britain had
rescued kingdoms from the tyrannical power of
the usurper; and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons,
who had largely shared in the attendant toils and
dangers, saw the cause in which they had been
engaged, triumphant over all opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>After reposing in quarters a short time at
Grammont, the regiment sent its dismounted men
and baggage to Bourdeaux, and commenced its
march through France to Boulogne, where it
embarked for England, and landed at Ramsgate
on the 7th of July, after an absence of four years
and five months, during which period it had
marched about <em>one thousand five hundred</em> leagues
(principally Spanish); it had been engaged in
<em>thirty-two</em> affairs, many of which were sharp
and contested, besides the general actions;
it had been <em>one hundred and ninety-seven</em> nights
in bivouac, and its casualties amounted to <em>two
hundred and seventy-four men</em>, and <em>one thousand
and nine horses</em>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons marched
from Ramsgate to Hounslow and its neighbourhood;
and having been inspected by His Royal
Highness the Commander-in-Chief, they proceeded
to Weymouth. The establishment was
reduced to eight troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>The regiment embarked at Plymouth, and
arrived at Cork in November. During the end
of this year and the beginning of 1815, the
regiment was distributed in quarters at Cork,
Fermoy, Mallow, Bandon, Limerick, Clogheen,
Gort, and Tallow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 6th of April, 1815, the royal authority
to bear on its guidons and appointments the
word "<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>," as a mark of the Prince
Regent's approbation of its conduct in Portugal,
Spain, and France, under Field Marshal His
Grace the Duke of Wellington, was communicated
to the regiment; and shortly afterwards
the veterans of the Peninsula were again employed
on foreign service; the return of Bonaparte
to France, his resumption of the imperial
dignity, and the flight of Louis XVIII. to
Flanders, having rekindled the flame of war on
the continent.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were augmented to ten
troops; and six troops, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Patrick Doherty, embarked at Cork at
the end of April and in the beginning of May;
they landed at Ostend, marched up the country,
and were formed in brigade with the Third
Hussars, King's German Legion, under Colonel
Sir Frederick Arentschildt, K.C.B.</p>

<p>On the 29th of May the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> were
present at Grammont at the review of the British
cavalry and artillery, commanded by the Earl of
Uxbridge, by His Grace the Duke of Wellington,
accompanied by Prince Blucher.</p>

<p>While the regiment was reposing in quarters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
waiting for the army to commence operations,
Bonaparte endeavoured, by a rapid advance, to
surprise the allies and beat them in detail. The
post at Quatre Bras was attacked, and this position
being fixed upon as the point of concentration
for the army under the Duke of Wellington,
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons
marched in that direction, and joined the army
during the night of the 16th of June.</p>

<p>The regiment, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Shapland Boyse, was employed in covering the
retreat from Quatre Bras to the position in front
of the village of <em>Waterloo</em>, on the 17th of June,
which had been rendered necessary by the defeat
and retrograde movement of the Prussians.</p>

<p>At the memorable battle of "<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>,"
on the 18th of June, 1815, the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Boyse,
had the good fortune to acquire additional laurels.
Eminent, as British troops ever have been, for
those warlike qualities which lead to glory in the
hour of battle, yet the field of "<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>" elevated
their reputation above its former standard,
and the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> have the honour of being
numbered among the corps which signalized themselves
in the "shock of steel." The regiment was
posted with the Seventh and Fifteenth Hussars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in the right centre of the position in the rear of
Hugomont; it charged repeatedly during the day
with the most distinguished success, the enemy's
cavalry and infantry, having some sharp sword
conflicts with the former; it also aided in the
successful attacks upon the advancing columns,
penetrated and completely routed a square of
infantry, and thus materially contributed to the
overthrow of the French army, which was driven
from the field with the loss of its cannon, ammunition,
waggons, and all its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</i>.</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment was Captain James
Gubbins, Lieutenants John Geale and John
Pymm, eleven rank and file, and fifteen horses
killed; Lieut.-Colonel Shapland Boyse, Captains
Joseph Doherty and Gregorie, Lieutenants
George Doherty, Charles Robert Bowers, John
A. E. Irving, James Mill, George H. Packe, ten
serjeants, two trumpeters, fifty-seven rank and
file, and forty-six horses, wounded: eight rank
and file and fifty-two horses missing.</p>

<p>Captain Brooks Lawrence, upon whom the
command of the regiment devolved in the course
of the day, had two horses killed and one wounded
under him.</p>

<p>The gallant conduct of troop serjeant-major
<em>Wells</em>, who commanded Captain Gubbins' troop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
after all the officers had fallen, was particularly
remarked; he was promoted into the second
West India regiment, and retired from the Fifty-fourth
regiment as a captain in 1841.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Doherty, besides being severely
wounded in the head, was struck by a ball
which was stopped by the interposition of his
watch, which it flattened. He had taken out
his watch to remark the time, when the regiment
was ordered to advance, and not being
able to return it, he put it into the breast of
his jacket, and thus providentially his life was
saved.</p>

<p>The regiment was subsequently rewarded
with the royal authority to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>"
on its guidons and appointments; every
officer and soldier present received a silver medal,
and the privilege of reckoning two years' service
for that day was also conferred on the troops.
Colonel Patrick Doherty and Lieut.-Colonel
Shapland Boyse, of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light
Dragoons, were made Companions of the Bath.</p>

<p>After passing the night on the field of battle,
the regiment advanced in pursuit of the French
army on their retreat to Paris, which city surrendered
to the British and Prussian armies.
This event terminated the campaign, Louis the
XVIIIth was restored, and the British troops
received the thanks of both houses of Parliament
for their distinguished conduct during this short
and most important struggle. The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Light Dragoons were stationed in the vicinity of
Paris, and took part in several grand reviews at
which the Emperors of Russia and Austria, and
the Kings of France and Prussia, were present.
On the formation of the army of occupation in
France, the Eleventh, <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, and Fifteenth
Light Dragoons constituted the third brigade of
cavalry under Major-General Sir Colquhoun
Grant, K.C.B.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>In the spring of 1816, the regiment having
received orders to return to England, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
embarked at Calais, and landed at Dover on the
13th of May, after an absence of one year and
a few days, during which period its casualties
amounted to three officers, sixty-five men, and
one hundred and four horses.</p>

<p>The regiment marched to Romford, where it
was reviewed by His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief.
In June it was distributed in
quarters at Newmarket, Bury St. Edmonds, Ely,
Peterborough, and Cambridge; and in July it
marched to York, sending, at different periods
during the latter part of this and in the beginning
of the following year, detachments to Carlisle,
Newcastle-on-Tyne, Tadcaster, Stockton-on-Tees,
Hull, Pontefract, Leeds, Halifax, and
Wakefield, where they were occasionally employed
in quelling riots. The establishment had
been reduced in October, 1816.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>The quarters were changed in July, 1817, to
Brighton, with detachments at Chichester, Arundel,
Hastings, and Eastbourne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>In the summer and autumn of 1818, the
regiment was stationed at Manchester, Stockport,
Blackburn, Bolton, and Preston, and was engaged
in quelling riots.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>Having received orders to prepare for embarkation
for India, the regiment marched to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Romford, where it was quartered a short time,
and in February, 1819, eight troops, commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Boyse, sailed from Gravesend;
they were four months on the voyage, and
landed at Madras on the 13th of June following.
After a short halt, the regiment marched
seventy-three miles up the country to Arcot,
the capital of the Carnatic, where it was stationed
during the remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820<br />1826</div>

<p>From Arcot the regiment was removed, in the
early part of 1820, to Bangalore, a military station
in Mysore, about two hundred miles from Madras.
At this station the regiment remained upwards of
six years, and in 1826, it was removed to Arcot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>In February, 1828, the regiment was encamped
at Arcot, from whence it was removed
to Arnee, a town of the Carnatic, fourteen miles
south of Arcot, and was stationed at that place
during the remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829</div>

<p>The regiment left Arnee in March, 1829, and
once more traversed the country to Bangalore,
where it was quartered during the remainder of
its stay in India.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1832</div>

<p>In 1832, the regiment was again clothed in
scarlet with buff facings.</p>

<p>The Mahommedans of Mysore entered into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
combination, in which some Sepoys of the force
at Bangalore joined, for the destruction of the
English officers and soldiers, and the subversion
of the British government in October, 1832;
but the discovery of this conspiracy on the day
fixed upon for its execution, caused immediate
precautions to be taken, which prevented the
outbreak. Many of the mutineers were taken,
tried, and sentenced,&mdash;some to death,&mdash;and the
remainder to transportation. The Sepoys were
executed in front of the assembled force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<p>In January, 1833, the royal authority was
given for the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons to
retain on their appointments the motto, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viret
in æternum</i>." This motto was borne by the
regiment when it was a corps of heavy cavalry,
and known by the name of the "<em>the green dragoons</em>,"
but was discontinued on its being made
light. The motto was subsequently resumed,
and the privilege of bearing it was confirmed to
the regiment by King William IV., as above
stated<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1836</div>

<p>In December, 1836, King William IV. was
pleased to command that the facing of the regiment
should be altered to <em>green</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1839</div>

<p>Two squadrons of the regiment, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Maclean, were detached
to Bellary in February, 1839, and formed
part of the force employed in the expedition
against the Nuwaub of Kurnool. In the affair
at <em>Zorapoor</em>, a party of the regiment, commanded
by Lieutenant Cameron, pursued the fugitives
across the river Toombuddra, and took several
prisoners; for which they were thanked in orders.
The regiment lost one man, drowned, on this
occasion. The two squadrons returned to Bangalore
on the 28th of November. They lost
thirty-two men, principally from cholera, and
six horses, on this service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<p>After passing upwards of twenty years in performing
the important duty of protecting the
British possessions in the south of India, the
regiment received orders to prepare to return to
England, and it marched to Madras in the beginning
of 1840<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, where it was reviewed by Major-General
Sir Robert Dick, K.C.B. and K.C.H.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and on the following day transferred its horses to
the Fifteenth Hussars; such non-commissioned
officers and soldiers as volunteered to remain in
India were then permitted to transfer their services
to other corps.</p>

<p>At the frequent reviews and inspections of
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>, during their service in India,
the regiment was invariably complimented on its
admirable system of interior economy, its high
state of discipline and efficiency, and the following
orders were issued previous to its leaving
Madras:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">"<em>Head-Quarters, Centre Division, Madras</em>,<br />
<span class="padr2"><em>29th January, 1840</em>.</span></p>

<p>"Major-General Sir Robert Dick was much
gratified this morning to find Her Majesty's
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons in such high
order. The major-general will not fail to
report to the general commanding-in-chief
the soldier-like appearance and steadiness of
the men, and the serviceable condition of the
horses; the movements were made with precision
and celerity, notwithstanding the heavy
sandy ground the regiment moved over; the
horses were well in hand; the advances in line
and trotting past were admirable. The major-general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
cannot help regretting the services of
so efficient a regiment will be so soon lost to
the Indian army. He sincerely wishes Colonel
Brunton, the officers, and men of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Light Dragoons a safe passage to
England."</p></div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">"<em>Head-Quarters, Fort St. George</em>,<br />
<span class="padr2"><em>17 February, 1840</em>.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">General Order.</span>&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light
Dragoons being ordered to embark, the major-general
commanding-in-chief cannot allow the
corps to quit this command, without recording
the high sense he entertains of its merits and
conduct during the period of its service in the
East. Although opportunities for adding to
its long-established fame and reputation in the
field have so rarely presented themselves to
this arm of the service since the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
formed a portion of the Madras army, the
major-general is well assured, that had occasion
called forth a display of its energies against
the enemy, it would have nobly sustained the
high character of the British cavalry. Good
conduct and discipline are qualities, however,
as essentially necessary to mark the meritorious
soldier out of the field as gallantry in
it; and in these attributes of the profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons have at all
times shone conspicuous.</p>

<p>"From having been in the division under his
own immediate command during a period of
more than two years, the major-general is
enabled to bear testimony (as well as from the
reports of his predecessors) to the uniform correctness
of its conduct, and throughout the
course of its lengthened service in Mysore,
he believes it may safely be asserted, that not
an instance has occurred of a complaint or
appeal being preferred against an officer, non-commissioned
officer, or private, of this distinguished
corps, to the civil authorities. In
taking leave, therefore, (for a time he hopes
only) of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Light Dragoons, the
major-general begs Lieut.-Colonel Brunton will
accept himself, and convey to the officers and
soldiers under his orders, the assurance of the
esteem the major-general feels for, and the
warm interest he shall ever take in, the prospects
and fair fame of the regiment; and it

<p>The regiment embarked from Madras in
February, and landed at Gravesend in June,
after an absence of twenty-one years and three
months, during which period its casualties
amounted to fifteen officers and one thousand and
fifty-one men.</p>

<p>The regiment marched to Canterbury, and
the establishment was reduced to six troops.</p>

<p>In June of this year the regiment resumed
wearing blue clothing with buff facing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>During the election at Canterbury in February,
1841, the regiment was quartered at Deal,
Sandwich, and Walmer; and when the general
election took place in June, it occupied Whitstable,
Herne Bay, and Margate, where it received
a vote of thanks from the inhabitants for
its orderly and exemplary conduct.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May the regiment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
inspected, mounted, by His Royal Highness the
Duke of Cambridge, who was pleased to express
in very strong terms, to Lieut.-Colonel Brunton,
his approbation of the appearance and forward
state of training of both men and horses. On this
occasion nearly one half of the men present had
joined as recruits since the return of the regiment
from India (ten months), and all were mounted
on young horses, which had been bought and
trained during that time.</p>

<p>The friendship of the "ragged brigade,"
which had commenced with, and had continued
throughout the eventful careers of the two regiments
in the Peninsula, was cemented afresh by
the arrival of the Fourteenth at Canterbury, to
prepare for service in India; when the Fourteenth
presented the regiment with their handsome mess
tables, to perpetuate in the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> a kindly
remembrance of their old companions in arms.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Brunton's exertions to complete
the regiment in men and horses had been
attended with the most favourable results; and
having attained a state of efficiency, it marched,
in August, to Ipswich and Norwich, crossing the
Thames at Gravesend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>In January, 1842, on the occasion of the visit
of the King of Prussia to England to attend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
christening of His Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales, the regiment was removed to Hampton
Court and Slough; and on the 4th of February
the troops at the former place marched, during
the night, to Woolwich, and were present in the
morning at a review of the artillery previous to
the embarkation of the King of Prussia. The
regiment returned from Hampton Court and
Slough to Ipswich and Norwich.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> regiment of Light Dragoons,
during its long and faithful services to its
sovereign and country in various quarters of the
globe, has, in peace and in war, under every circumstance
of service, vicissitude of climate, and
the trials incident thereto, distinguished itself by
the display of those qualities which ever acquire
unfading laurels in the field of action, and gain
respect and esteem for the British soldier.</p>

<p>"Yesterday a French captain of dragoons brought over a
trumpet, demanding permission to search amongst the dead for
his colonel. His regiment was a fine one, with bright brass
helmets and black horse-hair, exactly like what the old Romans
are depicted with. It was truly a bloody scene, being almost
all sabre wounds. It was long before we could find the French
colonel, for he was lying on his face, his naked body weltering
in blood; and as soon as he was turned up, the officer knew
him: he gave a sort of scream and sprang off his horse, dashed
his helmet on the ground, knelt by the body, took the bloody
hand and kissed it many times in an agony of grief; it was an
affecting and awful scene. I suppose there were about six hundred
naked dead bodies lying on the ground at one view. The
French colonel was killed by a corporal of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>.
This corporal had killed one of his men, and he was so enraged,
that he sallied out himself and attacked the corporal, who was
well mounted and a good swordsman, as was the colonel himself.
Both defended for some time; the corporal cut him twice across
the face; his helmet came off at the second, when the corporal
slew him by a cut which nearly cleft his skull asunder, cutting
in as deep as the nose through the brain."</p></div>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 22nd July, 1715</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Munden</span> served under King William III.
in the Netherlands, and also under the celebrated John
Duke of Marlborough, and was promoted to the rank
of colonel in 1706. On the 6th of May, 1709, he succeeded
Lord Lovelace in the colonelcy of a regiment of
foot, which served in the war of the Spanish succession,
and after distinguishing itself at Saragossa in 1710, it
was surrounded and made prisoners in the mountains of
Castille, by the army under the Duke of Vendosme.
In 1711 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general;
but the peace of Utrecht being concluded soon
afterwards, his regiment was disbanded, and he remained
unemployed until the summer of 1715, when he
was commissioned to raise a corps of dragoons&mdash;now
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> regiment of Light Dragoons. He
distinguished himself in the attack of the rebels at
Preston, in Lancashire, in November, 1715; and was
removed to the eighth dragoons in 1722. He died in
1725.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Sir Robert Rich, Baronet</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 19th November, 1722</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Robert Rich</span> entered the army in 1700, and
gave such signal proofs of courage and skill in the
wars in the reign of Queen Anne, that, on the 24th of
October, 1709, he was advanced to the command of a
regiment of foot. At the peace of Utrecht his regiment
was disbanded, and he remained for some time unemployed;
but being distinguished for his loyalty and
steady attachment to the Protestant succession, he was
commissioned to raise, in the summer of 1715, a regiment
of dragoons, which was instrumental in suppressing
the rebellion which broke out that year; but in
1718 it was disbanded. The services of Sir Robert
Rich were, however, not forgotten; he was appointed
one of the grooms of the bedchamber to the Prince of
Wales (afterwards George II.): and on the 19th of November,
1722, King George I. appointed him colonel of
the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons; from which he was removed,
in September, 1725, to the eighth dragoons;
and on the 1st of January, 1731, to the seventh horse,
now sixth dragoon guards. He was again removed in
1733 to the first troop of horse grenadier guards; and
in 1735 to the fourth dragoons; he was promoted to
the rank of major-general in 1735, to that of lieut.-general
in 1739, general in 1745; and in 1757 he was
advanced to the rank of field-marshal. He was a member
of Parliament, and governor of Chelsea Hospital.
He died in 1768.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">William Stanhope</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 20th September, 1725</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Stanhope</span>, youngest son of John Stanhope
of Elvaston, served several years in the third regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of foot guards, in which corps he obtained the
command of a company, with the rank of lieut.-colonel,
and on the 17th of March, 1711, he was promoted to
the colonelcy of a regiment of foot, which served in
Spain, but was disbanded in November, 1712. In the
summer of 1715, when the kingdom was menaced with
internal war, by the partizans of the Pretender, he
raised a regiment of dragoons for the service of King
George I.; and when the commotions, which followed,
were suppressed, his corps was disbanded. In 1717,
he was employed in a diplomatic character in Spain;
hostilities with that country commenced in 1719, and
he subsequently served as a volunteer with the French
army, commanded by Marshal Duke of Berwick. He
concerted a plan for the destruction of three Spanish
ships of the line, and a great quantity of naval stores,
in the port of St. Andero, which was effected by an
English squadron; Colonel Stanhope contributed to the
execution of this enterprise by accompanying a detachment
of troops, which Marshal Berwick sent, at his
solicitation, and was the first that leaped into the water
when the boats approached the shore. At the termination
of the war, he was again appointed envoy at the
Spanish court, and while employed in this service King
George I. conferred on him the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons. At the commencement of the war
with Spain, 1726&ndash;7, he returned to England, and was appointed
vice-chamberlain to the King; he was also
nominated one of the British plenipotentiaries at the
congress at Soissons; and he subsequently proceeded
to Spain and concluded the treaty of Seville. His distinguished
merits in these negotiations, were rewarded,
in November, 1729, with the title of <span class="smcap">Lord Harrington</span>,
in the county of Northampton; and on the resignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of Lord Townshend, he was nominated secretary
of state, which was followed by his vacating the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons. In the office of
secretary of state, his Lordship's knowledge of foreign
affairs, with his application to business, moderation,
good sense, and integrity, rendered him a valuable
servant to the crown. On the change of the ministry
he was appointed lord president of the council; and
in February, 1742, he was advanced to the dignity of
Viscount Petersham, and <span class="smcap">Earl</span> of <span class="smcap">Harrington</span>. In
1744 he was again appointed secretary of state; and in
1746 he was constituted lord lieutenant of Ireland. He
died in 1756.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Henry Hawley</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 7th July, 1730</em>.</p>

<p>This officer served the crown in four successive
reigns; and held a commission in the army during a
period of sixty-five years. His first appointment was
dated the 10th of January, 1694; and having signalized
himself in the wars of Queen Anne, he obtained the
rank of colonel by brevet dated the 16th of October,
1712. On the 19th of March, 1717, he was promoted
from the lieutenant-colonelcy of the fourth dragoons to
the colonelcy of the thirty-third regiment of foot; and
on the 7th of July, 1730, he was removed to the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons. In 1735 he was
promoted to the rank of brigadier-general; in 1739 to
that of major-general; and in the following year
obtained the colonelcy of the royal dragoons. In 1742
Major-General Hawley proceeded with the army to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Flanders, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general
in the following spring, and served at the battles
of Dettingen and Fontenoy. In 1746 he commanded
against the rebel Highlanders in Scotland, and the
troops under his orders had a sharp encounter with the
enemy near Falkirk, and sustained considerable loss.
He was afterwards on the staff of the army in Ireland;
and was many years governor of Portsmouth. He died
on the 24th of March, 1759.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Robert Dalway</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 12th May, 1740</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Dalway</span> was appointed cornet in a regiment
of cavalry on the 8th of March, 1704; he served
several campaigns under the celebrated John Duke of
Marlborough, and was distinguished for gallantry in
action, and a strict attention to duty. On the 1st of
February, 1713, he was promoted to the lieut.-colonelcy
of Harwich's horse, now seventh dragoon guards, and
in 1739, King George II. promoted him to the colonelcy
of the thirty-ninth foot, from which he was removed in
1740, to the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons. He died in November
of the same year.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Humphrey Bland</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 9th January, 1741</em>.</p>

<p>This officer's first commission was dated the 4th
of February, 1704, and he had the honour to serve
under the renowned John Duke of Marlborough. At
the augmentation of the army in the summer of 1715,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
he was appointed major of the eleventh dragoons, and
he subsequently obtained the lieut.-colonelcy of that
corps. He was employed in suppressing the rebellion
which broke out in 1715, and was wounded at the attack
of the insurgents at Preston, in Lancashire. He subsequently
held a commission in the royal dragoons, and
also in the King's horse, now first dragoon guards, and
in June, 1737, he was promoted to the colonelcy of the
thirty-sixth foot, from which he was removed to the
<span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons in 1741, and in 1743, he
obtained the colonelcy of the third dragoons. He
served as brigadier-general at the battle of Dettingen, in
1743, and at Fontenoy, in 1745. In the following
winter he served as major-general under the Duke of
Cumberland, in Scotland, where he signalized himself
on several occasions, and commanded a regiment of
cavalry at the battle of Culloden. He subsequently
returned to the continent, and was wounded at the
battle of Val, in 1747. In 1752, he was removed to the
colonelcy of the first dragoon guards, which he retained
until his decease in 1763.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">James Gardiner</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 18th April, 1743</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Gardiner</span>, son of Captain Patrick Gardiner,
who died while serving in Germany under the great
Duke of Marlborough, in 1704, was born in 1688. At
the commencement of hostilities, in 1701, he obtained a
commission in one of the Scots regiments in the Dutch
service, and in 1702, he was appointed ensign in a regiment
in British pay. He served under the Duke of
Marlborough, and at the battle of Ramilies, on the 23rd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of May, 1706, he was at the head of the troops which
attacked the French infantry posted in the church-yard,
and while in the act of planting his colours on an elevated
spot, and calling to his men to advance, he was
shot in the mouth. He lay all night on the ground,
and on the following day some foreign soldiers engaged
to remove him to Huy; but being unable to bear the
fatigue of the journey, they left him at a convent, where,
owing to the kind care of the lady abbess, and the aid
she procured, he recovered in a few months<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. This
year he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and he
was soon afterwards removed to the Scots Greys, commanded
by Lord John Dalrymple, afterwards Earl of
Stair, who became much attached to Lieutenant Gardiner.
On the re-formation of the seventh dragoons, in
February, 1715, Lieutenant Gardiner was appointed
captain-lieutenant in that corps, and in July following
he was promoted to captain, in Stanhope's dragoons, of
which regiment he was appointed major in 1717; but
in the following year this corps was disbanded. During
the war he was aide-de-camp to the Earl of Stair, and
he was attached to the splendid retinue of that nobleman,
while his lordship resided at Paris, as ambassador
extraordinary at that court, from whence he was
frequently despatched with important information to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
London. While thus employed he became changed,
from a sprightly participator in all the gaieties of life, to
one of the most sedate and pious men of the age in
which he lived, and was remarkable for his punctilious
observance of religious duties. His steady attachment
to the protestant succession, and numerous services,
were rewarded, on the 24th of January, 1730, with the
lieut.-colonelcy of the sixth dragoons, and he performed
the duties of commanding officer to this corps, many
years, with the most exemplary care and zeal. He proceeded
on foreign service with the Inniskilling dragoons,
in 1742, and soon after his arrival in Germany, in 1743,
he was promoted to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>
Dragoons. He commanded the regiment in Scotland,
in 1745, when the rebellion, headed by the Pretenders
eldest son, broke out in that country, and he eventually
joined the troops under Lieut.-General Sir John Cope.
During the night preceding the battle of Preston-pans,
the army occupied a position near his own family residence,
and he was attended by four of his domestic
servants, whom he dismissed about three o'clock, on the
following morning, with a pious exhortation to preserve
their loyalty to their sovereign. He spent a considerable
time in private devotion before the battle. At the
commencement of the action, he was wounded in the
left breast by a musket shot, which caused him to give
a sudden spring in his saddle, when his servant, who
held a spare horse, endeavoured to persuade him to
withdraw, but he refused, saying it was only a wound in
the flesh. In the charge, he behaved with the most
heroic gallantry, and afterwards attempted to rally his
men; but being unable to accomplish this, he joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
some infantry, and while in the act of encouraging them,
he was struck on the right arm by a Highlander with a
scythe fastened to a pole. His sword dropped; other
opponents came round him; he was unhorsed, and left
for dead. About two hours after the engagement had
ceased, his servant found him; he was alive, and the
servant removed him in a cart to Tranent church, from
whence he was conveyed to the minister's house, and
put to bed; but he expired soon afterwards. "In
person, Colonel Gardiner was strongly built and well-proportioned;
in stature unusually tall; and in the expression
of his countenance, intellectual and dignified.
In calm heroism, he has never been excelled. The
energy he displayed, notwithstanding his bodily infirmities,
on the day preceding the fight, at Preston-pans,
his pious exhortation to his domestics, his devotion before
the battle, and his calm unflinching bravery
during the contest, have thrown a romantic charm
around his memory, by which it will, doubtless, be long
and deservedly embalmed<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>."</p>

and, with his brother John, (afterwards Earl Ligonier,)
entered the British service. In his first commission
he was designated Francis de Ligonier, but the <em>de</em> was
afterwards discontinued. He was appointed major of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the eighth horse, now seventh dragoon guards, in 1729,
and lieut.-colonel in 1737, and under his care that
regiment became celebrated for efficiency and exemplary
conduct in quarters and in the field. He commanded
the eighth horse at the battle of Dettingen,
where he highly distinguished himself, and was
wounded; and he was rewarded in April, 1745, with
the colonelcy of the forty-eighth foot, from which he
was removed in October to the <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span> Dragoons.
He served under Lieut.-General Hawley, in Scotland,
in January, 1746, and while suffering from an attack
of the pleurisy, he quitted his bed to command the
cavalry at the battle of Falkirk, where he again signalized
himself; but fatigue, and exposure to the cold
and wet, brought on a disease, of which he died a few
days afterwards, much regretted by all who knew him.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
